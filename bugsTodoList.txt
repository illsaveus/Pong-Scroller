Yes I'm getting a bit ahead of myself making this, but I'm trying to limit the scope of this EARLY prototype to what I know for sure will be in the game, that's why the baddies don't really do anything but fly around and aren't even mentioned in this TODO list since I just don't know what they are going to do.
This TODO list is limited to things I know the game will have, I'm not worried about level design, baddies, scoring, etc.
I only care about the mechanics of the ball, paddles, and scrolling level. The only three elements I know will be a major part of the game for sure.


1. Paddles don't move along with the scene and therefore scroll to the left
2. Ball moves faster going left than going right
3. No instruction on how to move paddles
4. Lives/health aren't displayed
5.
