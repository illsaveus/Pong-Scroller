# Pong-Scroller
Pong Scroller is a Co-Op Pong/Galage type game where players must keep the ball alive and take out enemies in a scrolling playing field. This is a game created by GAX team members where I am currently playing the role as the Head Programmer (and likely sole programmer) for the project.
