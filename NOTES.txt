This is an EARLY prototype to test out the MOST BASIC elements of the game. The background is a simple texture to prove the game is scrolling through the level.

The blue blocks are just there to make it less boring.

The red baddies do nothing other than fly around and interact with nothing. Since I dont know yet what kinds of obstacles this game will have, I just added these for funsies.
